# GitHub & Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

Since Git is not installed on your system, follow these steps to get your website deployed:

### Step 1: Install Git

1. **Download Git for Windows**: Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. **Install Git**: Run the installer with default settings
3. **Restart your terminal/PowerShell** after installation

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

After installing Git, run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Queens Networking Society website with Lattice-inspired design"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/TS-SL/qns.git

# Push to GitHub (this will trigger Netlify deployment)
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Netlify Settings

Since Netlify is already connected to your repo, ensure these settings:

1. **Build Settings**:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: (leave empty)
   - Base directory: (leave empty)

2. **Deploy Settings**:
   - Branch to deploy: `main`
   - Auto-deploy: Enabled

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

Your project contains all necessary files:

```
qns/
├── index.html          # Home page with Lattice-inspired design
├── about.html          # About Us page
├── contact.html        # Contact page with form
├── styles.css          # Modern CSS with green theme

```

## 🎯 Netlify Deployment Checklist

## 🔧 Formspree Setup (After Deployment)

1. **Sign up for Formspree**: Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. **Create new form**: Get your form endpoint URL
3. **Update contact.html**: Replace `example@domain.com` with your Formspree URL
4. **Commit and push changes**:

   git commit -m "Update contact form with Formspree endpoint"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
